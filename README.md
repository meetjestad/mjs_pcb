Meetjestad PCB repository
=========================

This repository contains various versions of the sensor station PCB used
by [Meetjestad](https://www.meetjestad.net).

The easiest way to see the various version is to have a look at the
releases on Github, which are tagged with the version number. The
release pages also contain rendered (PDF) schematics and board files.

Software
--------
These boards can be programmed using the Arduino environment. The
necessary configuration and support files to allow this, along with
instructions can be found in the [mjs_boards
repository](https://github.com/meetjestad/mjs_boards).

The firmware typically used on these boards is published in the
[mjs_firmware repository](https://github.com/meetjestad/mjs_firmware)
(mjs2020 branch for the MJS2020 board).

License
-------
The original MJS sensor board is designed by Harmen Zijp, together with
Matthijs Kooijman. The MJS2020 board is partly based on the original
board and is designed by [KITT Engineering](https://www.kitt.nl/en/),
together with Harmen Zijp and Matthijs Kooijman.

The design for both boards is open hardware and licensed
under the the CERN-OHL-W v2 license. Any designs derived from or
containing parts of this design must be similarly licensed. See the
